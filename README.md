# Better Enums

Reflective compile-time C++11 enum library with clean syntax. For example:

    ENUM(Channel, int, Red = 1, Green, Blue);

defines a type `Channel`. You can then do natural things like:

```cpp
Channel channel = Channel::Green;

channel.to_string();            // Results in the string "Green"
channel.to_integral();          // Results in the int 2

Channel::_from_string("Red");   // Results in Channel::Red
Channel::_from_integral(3);     // Results in Channel::Blue

constexpr auto channel = Channel::_from_integral(3);
                                // Do it at compile time
constexpr auto channel = Channel::_max;
                                // Channel::Blue

for (Channel channel : Channel::_values) {
    // Iterate over all channels
}
```

...and more. See the

tutorial.

## Installation

Simply add `enum.h` from `master` to your project.

## Features

- Generated at compile time by `constexpr` functions and the preprocessor.
- Safe conversions between enums and integers and strings.
  [1-basic.cc](https://github.com/aantron/better-enums/blob/master/example/1-basic.cc)
- Iterable collections of constants and names.
  [2-iterate.cc](https://github.com/aantron/better-enums/blob/master/example/2-iterate.cc)
- Range information, such as the number of constants defined and the maximum
  constant.
  [2-iterate.cc](https://github.com/aantron/better-enums/blob/master/example/2-iterate.cc)
- Switch case checking.
  [3-switch.cc](https://github.com/aantron/better-enums/blob/master/example/3-switch.cc)
- All operations are `constexpr` and can be used at compile time in your own
  `constexpr` code.
  [4-constexpr.cc](https://github.com/aantron/better-enums/blob/master/example/4-constexpr.cc)
- Constant values can be set (`Red = 1`) and aliased (`Favorite = Green`), just
  like with built-in enums.
- Generating a large number of enums is about as fast as including a typical
  standard header like `iostream` â€“ performance test included.
- Explicit choice of underlying representation type.
- Header-only.
- No dependencies besides the standard library.
- Tested on gcc 4.9 and clang 3.6.

The library is standard C++, but it compiles only with gcc and clang due to
lagging C++11 support in msvc. A future runtime fallback version will allow
msvc and non-C++11 usage.

## Explanation

The `ENUM` macro specializes a template based around a regular `enum`
declaration, though it is more similar to `enum class` in the degree of type
safety. The following are spiritually equivalent:

    ENUM(Channel, int, Red = 1, Green, Blue);
    enum class Channel : int {Red = 1, Green, Blue};

    ENUM(Depth, char, Indexed8Bit, HighColor, TrueColor);
    enum class Depth : char {Indexed8Bit, HighColor, TrueColor};

See the full [documentation](http://aantron.github.io/better-enums).

## Development plan

There are several areas that still need improvement.

- Some enum types might have a sensible choice for a default constructor. The
  library should allow it to be customized.
- All safety checks are currently done by linear scans. This may be a
  performance problem for enum types with many constants.
- Better diagnostics for empty enums or too many constants.
- Conversions from integers and strings that don't throw exceptions, but
  indicate failure by some other means.

## License

Better Enums is released under the BSD 2-clause license. See
[LICENSE](https://github.com/aantron/better-enums/blob/master/LICENSE).

## History

The library was originally developed by the author in the winter of 2012-2013 at
Hudson River Trading, as a replacement for an older generator called
`BETTER_ENUM`.
