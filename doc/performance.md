## Performance

This is a placeholder page &mdash; the only testing done so far shows that
compiling a large (30+) enums on clang is faster than merely including
`iostream`. More conclusive information coming today or in a few days! For the
clang test, compilation of all those Better Enums takes about 60% of the time
that processing `iostream` does.
